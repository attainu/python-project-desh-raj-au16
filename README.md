# Chess Game Attain-U Project: -


Hello, my name is Desh raj. I have selected a Chess Game as my first project for python DSA.
This Chess game made using Pygame and it uses OOPs principles as there are classes Fir GUI.
It is just plain and simple 2 Player chess But it supports all Chess features like move validation, Pawn promotion, Check-Checkmate-Stalemate detection, Castling, and En-passant.
Apart from all valid chess logic, I also added interactive Gui that lets users know which side is to make the move if a performed move is legal or not, events a stalemate occurs. And  I also added a little bit of AI part but for this, you have to uncomment some code parts.

## Requirements: -

1)	Python 3.6 or python 3.9
2)	Pygame

## How to play: - 

Ensure that you have Python 3.9 or 3.6 and Pygame installed. After that run ChessMain.py using terminal or python IDE such as Visual studio code or Pycharm.
